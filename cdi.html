    <h1>Cross Domain Iframe Test - XDomain Level - 2</h1>
    
    <p>
        This test file is designed for cross-domain iframe testing. 
        A cross-domain iframe is an HTML element that allows you to embed content from a different domain (i.e., a domain other than the one hosting your web page) within your web page. 
        This is often used for integrating content like videos, maps, or external tools into your site. 
        However, it can present challenges related to security and access due to browser restrictions that protect user data and prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
